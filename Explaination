This program helps you manage a list of tasks.

The first line of the code, import os, imports a module called "os" which helps you interact with your computer's operating system.

The second line, tasks = [], creates an empty list called "tasks" where you can store your tasks.

The next four functions, remove_task(), save_tasks(), load_tasks(), and add_task(), are functions that you can call to perform specific actions on your list of tasks.

The view_tasks() function is called when you want to see your list of tasks.

The while loop that follows allows you to interact with the program by displaying a list of options and asking for your input. 

The if statements check your input and call the appropriate function based on your choice.

The program will continue to loop and ask for input until you choose option 6 to quit.

Finally, if the tasks list is empty and a file called "tasks.txt" exists, the program will remove the file as a cleanup step.

Overall, this program helps you manage a list of tasks by allowing you to add, view, remove, save, and load tasks.
