This project is a simple command-line to-do list application written in Python.
The user is presented with a menu that allows them to add new tasks to the list or view the current list of tasks.
When the user chooses to add a task, they are prompted to enter the task name, which is then added to the list of tasks.
When the user chooses to view the tasks, the program displays the list of tasks, one per line. If the user chooses to quit the program, the program ends.
This program can be useful for individuals who want a quick and simple way to keep track of their to-do list without the need for a more complex application. 
The program is easily extendable and can be modified to include additional features such as the ability to edit or delete tasks, set reminders or due dates, 
or sort tasks by priority.
