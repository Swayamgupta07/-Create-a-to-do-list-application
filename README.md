This code is a simple to-do list application. It allows you to add, view, remove, save, and load tasks from a file.

You can choose an option from a menu by entering a number. If you select "Add a task", you can enter a new task and it will be added to the list.  

If you select "View tasks", it will display a numbered list of all the tasks you have added.

If you choose "Remove a task", it will display the list of tasks and ask you to enter the number of the task you want to remove. 

If you enter a valid number, the task will be removed from the list.

You can also save and load tasks to and from a file using the "Save tasks" and "Load tasks" options.

If you choose "Quit", the program will exit. If the list is empty and a task file exists, it will remove the file.
